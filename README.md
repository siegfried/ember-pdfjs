This addon will provide some useful components for viewing and interacting with PDF documents to your `ember-cli` project. This addon unites the Ember framework ecosystem and the [PDFJS](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) open source project by Mozilla.

## Installation

Within your `ember-cli` project:

* `ember install ember-pdfjs`

This will add a `pdf-document` component to your application.

## Standalone Sample
Though this project is an `addon` type for including a component in your Ember project, you can also kick the tires on the component in a live sample with this project.

````
git clone git@github.com:mysterlune/ember-pdfjs.git
cd ember-pdfjs && npm install
ember serve
````

... and in typical Ember fashion, a development server will fire up on port `4200`. Then, simply visit:

````
http://localhost:4200
````

... and take a look at the familar, lovely "tracemonkey" document.

## Usage

In a template, just do:

````
{{pdf-document src=[model.src]}}
````

or

````
{{pdf-document src="/path/to/your.pdf"}}
````

`[model.src]` can be a `Uint8Array`, as `PDFJS` allows this as a source type for the `...getDocument()` signature.

### Password Protected PDF Support

The addon also allows for the registration of an Ember action handler for use when a PDF is password protected.  In a template
you would add an action closure:

````
{{pdf-document src=[model.src] onPassword=(action 'myPasswordAction')}}

````

The associated action handler would look something like the following:

````
import { PasswordResponses } from 'ember-pdfjs/components/pdf-document';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
    actions: {
        'myPasswordAction': function(setPassword, reason) {
            // The reason value provides an indication of first prompt
            // versus incorrect password prompt
            let promptText = 'Enter the password to open this PDF file.';
            if (reason === PasswordResponses.INCORRECT_PASSWORD) {
                promptText = 'Invalid password. Please try again.';
            }

            // Prompt the user for their password in some application-specific way
            let password = promptUserForPassword(promptText);

            // Callback with the password received from the prompt
            setPassword(password);
        }
    }
});
````

The action receives two parameters:
 * setPassword - A callback function that is used to set the password received from the user
 * reason - The "reason" that the password is being requested.  One of:
   * PasswordResponses.NEED_PASSWORD (First time prompt)
   * PasswordResponses.INCORRECT_PASSWORD (Re-prompt when previous password was incorrect)

### Note on Security
You will get errors and it will not load if you try to link to something not hosted on your domain. You will need to update `contentSecurityPolicy` in your Ember project accordingly.

Checkout [Ember Igniter](https://emberigniter.com/modify-content-security-policy-on-new-ember-cli-app/) for a how-to on updating `contentSecurityPolicy` for your app.


## Caveats
The goals of this project are spelled out in [Issues](https://github.com/mysterlune/ember-pdfjs/issues/2). If there are recommendations that you need for own project, likely they will benefit others.

## Running Tests

* `ember test`

## Contributing
If you have an "ember-ish"/"pdf.js-ish" addon project in the works -- or don't think this project will work for your needs -- please let's try to pull this together into one solution.

The Ember Community maintains a fundamental precept of common solutions to common problems. Proliferating addon solutions is kinda bunk, from a community perspective.

Please contribute!
